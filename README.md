At Sharix we collect all kinds of information and sources of movies and shows so that they can be easily watched. Part of the fun with such data is making it available for anyone to process and use on their own website or app. The Sharix API was developed for exactly this purpose. It's very simple to use, you basically call a URL and get some JSON back.
